# Test coverage 

As a developer many of your projects probably has tests, but do you ask yourself how much of your code is executed when the tests are ran?! :thinking:	

Today we will be introduce to code coverage which answers our question and measures our code to know which parts of the code are not reached by the tests.

## What is Test Coverage?

Test coverage is a technique which determines whether our test cases are actually covering the application code and how much code is executed when we run those test cases.

So if you have code of 1000 lines and you make tests and 600 line where executed when you ran the test then you test coverage is 60%.

## Benefits of Test Coverage:

* Identify untested area.
* It can assure the quality of the test.
* Prevent Defect early.
* Time, scope and cost can be kept under control.
* You can find broken code.
* You won't break your code as easily while refactoring.


There are many code coverage tools available to measure your code coverage. In this workshop we will be introduce to Istanbul and nyc library testing tool which checks test unit coverage.


## Task 
* Clone the repo.
* Run npm i
* Run npm test
